# Exercism's Open Source Stats

We would like to understand more about what is happening across the Exercism GitHub organisation, where the activity is, who is contributing where, etc.

The aim of this repository is to put together scripts that work against the GitHub API, and the output of them. We can then periodically run them to understand whether Exercism is getting stronger or weaker, and which areas need the most help and support.

There is a tracking issue on the [main Exercism repository](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4427) for this.

This repository has specifically been set up during **Hacktoberfest** :)
